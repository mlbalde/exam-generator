Suppose you have a large file written in LaTeX containing many exam questions. (single or multiple choice questions).

For each exam you (as a teacher) want to select a number of questions from this file and compile an exam sheet.

This piece of software takes this larger latex file, process it and randomly generates an exam sheet.

Short list of features:

  * Control the total number of questions, the number of false/correct choices per question
  * Control the grouping of the questions
  * Control (to some degree) which questions are randomized and which are not.
  * Recognizes section, enumerate, verbatim, listings environments.
  * Minimum manual intervention to your existing LaTeX file if you use the previous packages and environments.
  * Open source so feel free to hack it for your own needs (need to know some java).
  * Written in Java, should work on any platform
  * "Tested" for actual exams.
